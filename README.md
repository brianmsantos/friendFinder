This homework proved to be more difficult than I originally thought.  I had problems with the path and all I missing was ".app". Todd helped me look at the code and find the missing portion of the code. Once I was able to link the server and the other JS files I tried to do the get on the htmlRoute.js file and I kept running into this error 

{ Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './app./public./home.html'

The path is correct and I tried different variations but it still would not located the correct path. I got stuck there for hours googling and watching videos and still not working.  

I learned that I will have to find a workaround to this or find the error and learn that there are so many multiple ways to do code.  I need to up my research and studying game because this stuff comes easier at the beginning of the lesson plans but when putting everything together I always end up hitting a wall.
